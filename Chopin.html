Chopin's personal struggles and experiences are often reflected in his music, which is known for its emotional depth and introspective quality. Chopin and Sand first met in Paris in 1836 and began a passionate romantic relationship that lasted for nearly a decade. Their relationship was tumultuous, marked by both deep affection and conflict.
